# Recommendation-System-and-Segmentation-by-Matrix-Fatorization
We build a recommendation system. For example, movie suggestions can be given to people based on the films they liked in the past.

This is a Python implementation based on the paper: "Algorithms for Non-negative Matrix Factorization" https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2000/file/f9d1152547c0bde01830b7e8bd60024c-Paper.pdf
as well as "Sparse NMF â€“ half-baked or well done?" http://www.jonathanleroux.org/pdf/LeRoux2015SparseNMF03.pdf
